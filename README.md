# 🔌 Build Your Own Digital Computer (from Transistors)

A hands-on, modular project to build digital logic circuits — **starting from basic transistors all the way to registers, counters, and a simple ALU**. This project uses only **discrete components** (no microcontrollers or ICs) to demonstrate how computers work at the lowest level.

## 📚 Introduction & Background

Modern computers are built using millions of transistors — but how do they actually store and process data? This project explores that question by guiding you to **build a working digital system step-by-step**, using **just basic NPN transistors, resistors, buttons, and LEDs**.

> 💡 You’ll learn about binary numbers, logic gates, flip-flops, registers, counters, and eventually construct simple computing blocks.
